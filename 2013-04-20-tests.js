/**
 * What did we do well?
 *  - Good teamwork, good communication (with reminders)
 *  - Got much further than ever before.
 *  - Mostly baby steps.
 *  - Understanding concepts and syntax better.
 *  - Looked up questions
 * 
 * What should we improve?
 *  - PRACTICE Baby Steps
 *  - PRACTICE Following the Spec
 *  - PRACTICE Writing the right tests.
 *  - STUDY concepts and syntax
 * 
 * Did we meet our goals?
 *  - Learned about chaining methods on a return value of a function
 *  - Learned about "Array.map()"
 *  - Didn't finish the problem; made it to "first pass"
 *  - Learned some "this" magic...
